  <h2>Timetable Generator Website (Under Construction)</h2>

  <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
  <p>
    A full-stack web application developed as part of a System Analysis and Design (SAD) and Software Engineering academic project. The system is designed to streamline and automate the academic scheduling process, providing a user-friendly interface for students to manage their course timings.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Stack:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Framework:</strong> MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Core Features &amp; System Design:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Algorithmic Schedule Generation:</strong> The core system is designed to process academic constraints and automatically generate multiple valid timetable variations and options.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Student-Centric Workflow:</strong> The primary user experience focuses on the student's role within the system. Instead of building a schedule from scratch, students can review the pre-generated timetable options and select the one that is most convenient for their personal routine.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>System Analysis Application:</strong> The project practically applies System Analysis and Design and Software Engineering principles to map out user roles (specifically the student's interaction with the system) and data flow between the React frontend and the Node.js/MongoDB backend.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Current Status:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Under Construction:</strong> The application is currently in the active development and implementation phase.
    </li>
  </ul>
